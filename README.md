# Bellwether Showcase
This repository contains code examples for Bellwether's R Data Analysis Support Services RFQ.

The following files may be useful in evaluating my capabilities:
- **data_cleaning.R** is an example of cleaning publicly available data and producing a sample data visualization. The data visualizations produced by this code "fig1.svg" and "fig2.svg" in this repository.
- **webscraping.R** is a more complicated example of my coding skills that performs a webscrape of teacher job postings and processes that data. Note that this code calls functions that I have not uploaded to this repository and, so, cannot be run.
- **automated_report.qmd** is an example of using Quarto, LaTeX, and tidyverse packages to create an automated report. An example of one of 260 such reports created by this code is available as "automated_report_example.pdf."
- **value_add_webapp.R** is a Shiny user interface I developed for a school system. Some elements (e.g., file upload) rely upon dependencies that are not in this repository and, so, are not functional in this example. Screenshots of this webapp are available as "vam_1.png," "vam_2.png," and "vam_3.png."
- Additionally, examples of interactive data visualizations I've made using Shiny are embedded in this blog post: https://oep.uark.edu/teacher-salaries-under-the-arkansas-learns-act/

Please feel free to contact me if you have further questions.
